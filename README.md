#GRAPHICS ENGINE

CREATE A 3D RENDERER WITH OPENGL THEN MIGRATE TO VULKAN

CREATE A 2D RENDERER WITH GLES3 THEN MIGRATE TO VULKAN


this is my simple c++ project to create a game engine.
first version will be with opengl and render only 2d scenes and graphics.

the purpose of the project is to learn how to create a custom engine for game development.

the architecture of the project will support multiple rendering sysytem such as openGL gles vulkan 

initial render will be opengl 3.3 and render 2d scene only 

initially i will start rendering 2d scenes then extend to render 3d scenes both with opengl and vulkan
